## Validation

The `validation.ts` file contains centralized validation logic that mirrors the original PayloadCMS validation:

- Field length validation
- Assessment weight validation (ensures total doesn't exceed 100%)
- Grade validation (0-100 range)
- Email format validation
- Icon validation
- Date validation

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Subject

```typescript
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

const subjectId = await convex.mutation(api.subjects.createSubject, {
  name: 'Advanced React Development',
  code: 'COMP3001',
  description: 'Advanced concepts in React development including hooks, context, and performance optimization',
  term: 'Semester 1, 2024',
  coordinatorName: 'Dr. Jane Smith',
  coordinatorEmail: 'jane.smith@university.edu',
  userId: currentUser._id,
})
```

### Creating an Assessment

```typescript
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

const assessmentId = await convex.mutation(api.assessments.createAssessment, {
  name: 'Final Project',
  icon: 'üíª',
  contribution: 'individual',
  weight: 40,
  task: 'Build a full-stack React application with authentication and real-time features',
  dueDate: new Date('2024-06-15').getTime(),
  userId: currentUser._id,
  subjectId: subjectId,
})
```

### Adding Tasks to an Assessment

```typescript
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

await convex.mutation(api.assessmentTasks.addTask, {
  assessmentId: assessmentId,
  name: 'Set up project structure',
  status: 'todo',
  priority: 'high',
  description: 'Initialize React app with TypeScript and set up basic routing',
})

await convex.mutation(api.assessmentTasks.addTask, {
  assessmentId: assessmentId,
  name: 'Implement authentication',
  status: 'todo',
  priority: 'medium',
  reminder: new Date('2024-05-15').getTime(),
})
```

### Querying Data

```typescript
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

// Get all active subjects for current user
const subjects = await convex.query(api.subjects.getSubjectsByUser, {
  userId: currentUser._id,
  includeArchived: false,
})

// Get upcoming assessments
const upcomingAssessments = await convex.query(api.assessments.getUpcomingAssessments, {
  userId: currentUser._id,
  daysAhead: 14, // Next 2 weeks
})

// Get tasks in progress
const activeTasks = await convex.query(api.assessmentTasks.getTasksByUserAndStatus, {
  userId: currentUser._id,
  status: 'doing',
})
```

## Migration Notes

This Convex implementation preserves the core functionality of the original PayloadCMS configuration while adapting to Convex's patterns:

1. **Relationships**: PayloadCMS relationships are converted to Convex ID references
2. **Hooks**: PayloadCMS hooks are replaced with validation functions
3. **Access Control**: PayloadCMS access control is handled at the application level (you'll need to implement user authentication)
4. **Arrays**: PayloadCMS array fields are converted to separate tables with foreign keys
5. **Timestamps**: Convex automatically handles `_creationTime`, eliminating the need for manual timestamp management

## Authentication

This implementation assumes you're using Convex Auth (as evidenced by the `authTables` import in the schema). You'll need to:

1. Set up Convex Auth in your application
2. Implement user authentication flows
3. Add user context to function calls
4. Implement proper access control based on user ownership

## Next Steps

1. Implement user authentication using Convex Auth
2. Create frontend components that interact with these Convex functions
3. Add search functionality using Convex's full-text search capabilities
4. Implement real-time updates for collaborative features
5. Add file upload capabilities for assessment submissions using Convex File Storage
