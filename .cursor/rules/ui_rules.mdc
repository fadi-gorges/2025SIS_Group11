Prefer using arrow functions over function declarations for all functions and components.

You must use Shadcn UI components for all UI components. Consult the available documentation of Shadcn UI for the available components and their props.

You must also use Origin UI components when available. These components are built on top of Shadcn UI and are higher quality, so you should use them when available. Consult the available documentation of Origin UI for the available components and their props.

When building forms, you must use the `Form` component from Shadcn UI, combined with `react-hook-form` for form handling and `zod` for form validation.
Current zod validation schemas are located in `convex/validation.ts`. You can use them or extend them as needed.
