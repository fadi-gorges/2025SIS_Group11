You must use zod for all form validation. Current zod validation schemas are located in `convex/validation.ts`. You can use them or extend them as needed.

Each zod schema field should have a user-friendly validation error message, that can be used in the UI.

Any constant validation limits should be defined in the `VALIDATION_LIMITS` object.

Zod strings should be trimmed.
